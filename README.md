# Weather

In this project, I look at patterns that can help one to work with third party code, and integrate existing components into ones applications, whilst maintaining a good design for ones own code. I have built an application that uses temperature data (maybe it is a news app, a holiday destination finder, or something similar). There is a library that can retrieve weather forecasts for me, but accessing this data can be slow. To address this, I have built a local cache for this data to be used by my application, so that data can be returned more quickly.
